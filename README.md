# text_classification

## In my journey of learning NLP this is the first NLP task I have stumbled upon
** Text Classification **
* Text Classification is a common task in NLP 
- The goal is to assign the text/document a label (positive/negative)

p.s. I will implement most things using PyTorch and several nlp-specific libraries like nltk, gensim, etc.
