# text_classification

## In my journey of learning NLP this is the first NLP task I have stumbled upon
<b> Text Classification </b>
* Text Classification is a common task in NLP 
- The goal is to assign the text/document a label (positive/negative)
- All the code in this repository are from book `practical NLP by OReilly`

p.s. I will implement most things using PyTorch and several nlp-specific libraries like nltk, gensim, etc.
